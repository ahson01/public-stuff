In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [**manipulation** is defined as an action designed to influence or control another person, usually in an underhanded or unfair manner which facilitates one's personal aims.

So in layman's terms, manipulation is basically controlling someone indirectly or directly to reach your goals! Let's give real examples where you would use this.

## Achieving a specific goal:

- A salesperson might use persuasive (borderline manipulative) tactics to close a deal, including lying about product features, fabricating testimonials, or using high-pressure tactics to coerce a purchase.

- A negotiator might use psychological pressure to gain an advantage in a negotiation, such as deliberately misleading the other party, withholding crucial information, or using threats and intimidation.
	- Sabotaging a competitors work to gain an advantage.
	- Stealing intellectual property to gain a financial advantage.
	- 
## Influencing behavior:

- In some cases, a parent might use mild forms of manipulation to encourage a child to behave in a certain way (though ethical parenting emphasizes open communication), but unethical parents might use emotional blackmail, gaslighting, or threats of abandonment to control their children.

	- A leader might use persuasive language to motivate a team, but unethical leaders might use fear-mongering, scapegoating, or divide-and-conquer tactics to maintain control.
	- Spreading false rumors about an individual to damage their reputation.
	- Using social media bots to create a false sense of popularity or consensus.
## Political contexts:

- Political figures can use manipulative tactics to gain votes, or to influence public opinion, including spreading disinformation, engaging in character assassination, and exploiting societal divisions.

	- Gerrymandering (Manipulation) voting districts to unfairly influence election results.
	- Suppressing voter turnout through intimidation or misinformation.
	- Accepting bribes or engaging in corrupt practices to gain political power.
	- Using deep fake technology to create false videos of political opponents.

# So now, you wanna know how to do this? ;)
