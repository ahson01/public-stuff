This document outlines my approach to improving memory retention, particularly for factual information where understanding is either difficult or unnecessary. While this method reduces the need for repetitive practice, it does not eliminate it entirely. By leveraging my Obsidian notes, I will document the results of these techniques to enhance memory retention and ensure effective information intake. The ultimate goal is to make my studies as efficient and effortless as possible.

## 1) Summarized Mental Walkthrough**

After completing a topic, I will write a concise summary in my own words without referring to any notes. This reinforces understanding and aids in recall.

## 2) Chunking & Pattern Recognition**

To simplify complex information, I will use large language models like ChatGPT to identify patterns and organize data efficiently. This will help me recognize connections and structures within the material.

# 3) The Peg System (Fixed Associations)

I will use a pre-memorized set of keywords linked to numbers to remember information in a structured order.

- **Example Peg Words:**
    
    - 1 = Gun
    - 2 = Shoe
    - 3 = Tree
- **Application:**
    
    - If the **Magna Carta (1215)** is the second key event, I will visualize a shoe (2) stepping on a scroll to create a strong mental association.
