In middle school, during the only period where we're allowed free e.g. break time / lunch period, we're asked by our peers to share lunch.

- You have **a limited resource** (your lunch).
- During the only time youâ€™re free (break/lunch), peers may ask you to **share what you have**.
- You have to decide: Do you share? With whom? How much?
