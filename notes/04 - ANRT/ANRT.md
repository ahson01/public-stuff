-# This term was coined by Ahson in 2025 to capture a form of cognition overlooked by existing terminology.

**Abstract Noetic Representational-Free Thinking (ANRT)** refers to the immediate, intuitive grasp of patterns, relationships, or structures without mediation through words, imagery, or symbolic representation. It is “knowing without representation”: felt, direct, and holistic.
