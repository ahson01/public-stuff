**Abstract Noetic Representational-Free Thinking (ANRT)** refers to the immediate, intuitive grasp of patterns, relationships, or structures without mediation through words, imagery, or symbolic representation. It is a raw form of knowing or grasping relationships and patterns without encoding them in language or imagery. It involves manipulating ideas as meanings themselves, without the need to translate them into words or mental pictures. 

_This term was coined by Ahson in 2025 to capture a form of cognition overlooked by existing terminology._
